# Resume-Reactor (Curriculum Vitae)

The purpose of this project is that it will allow the user to make a resume similar to Jakes Resume Template!
It will accept the same parameters as the Latex Template does.
This is not a subsitute for spending quality time and using the actual Latex Template, but it instead allows you to quickly make a resume on the fly.
I hope you like the names alliteration.

A website totally generated with React, TailwindCSS, Vite, and more!
